This Library Management System is a simple web application designed for managing library operations such as book issuance, returns, membership management, and fine payments. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

Features:
Login System:

Users can log in as either Admin or User. The admin has full access to manage books, memberships, and fines, while users can only return books and pay fines.

Admin Panel:

Issue Books: Admin can issue books by entering a book ID, and if available, it updates the book's status to "issued."

Return Books: Admin can return books, and if overdue, a fine is calculated based on the number of overdue days.

Manage Memberships: Admin can update a user's membership duration (6 months, 1 year, or 2 years).

Pay Fine: Admin can process fines, although this functionality is simple in the current version.

User Panel:

Return Books: Users can return borrowed books. If the book is overdue, a fine is calculated and displayed.

Pay Fine: Users can check if they have fines and proceed to pay them (though the actual fine payment process is simplified).

Books Table:

The application displays a table of available books, showing their title, author, and availability. The table is dynamically updated based on user and admin actions.

Fine Calculation:

If a book is returned late, the system calculates a fine of $1 per day based on the overdue days.

User Interface:

The system has a clean and straightforward UI, which is responsive and provides clear feedback, such as error messages for invalid actions.
